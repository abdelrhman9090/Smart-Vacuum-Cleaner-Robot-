# 🧹Smart-Vacuum-Cleaner-Robot
A smart vacuum cleaner robot built using Arduino, Motor Shield, Ultrasonic Sensor, and a servo motor to autonomously navigate indoor environments, avoid obstacles, and simulate intelligent vacuum-cleaning behavior.

# 📷 Project Description
The Smart Vacuum Cleaner Robot moves autonomously while scanning its surroundings.
When an obstacle is detected, the robot:
1-Stops immediately
2-Moves backward to create space
3-Scans right and left using a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor
4-Chooses the direction with more free space
5-Performs a pivot turn and continues cleaning
This behavior mimics real-world robotic vacuum cleaners.
